# Assembly-language-for-a-microprocessor.
The project consists of assembly code segments implementing various algorithms and procedures. These segments are designed to run on a specific microprocessor architecture, optimizing performance and resource utilization.

Features
String Manipulation: Includes subroutines for tasks such as finding characters in a string, compressing and decompressing strings, verifying string lengths, and more.

Efficient Algorithms: The subroutines are designed to be efficient in terms of both time and space complexity, making them suitable for use in performance-critical applications.

Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Assemble the source code using an appropriate assembler for your target architecture.
Link the assembled object files to create an executable program.
Use the provided subroutines in your own programs by calling them as needed.
Project Structure
src/: Contains the assembly source code files for the subroutines.
docs/: Contains documentation for the subroutines, including usage examples and performance considerations.
examples/: Contains example programs demonstrating the use of the provided subroutines.
